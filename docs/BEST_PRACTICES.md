## Architecture Best Practices

### Microservices Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each service should have a well-defined, bounded context and responsibility.
   - The Context Management service handles conversation contexts
   - The DevOps Tool Integration service manages interactions with external tools
   - The Vector Search service handles embedding storage and retrieval

2. **Design for Resilience**: Always assume that components may fail and design for graceful degradation.
   - Implement circuit breakers for external service calls
   - Use timeouts appropriately for all external APIs
   - Provide fallback mechanisms when dependent services are unavailable

3. **Stateless Services**: Services should be stateless whenever possible to enable scaling.
   - Externalize state to appropriate data stores
   - Use Redis for caching and ephemeral data
   - Store durable state in the database
   - Treat each request as independent

4. **Asynchronous Communication**: For non-time-critical operations, use message queues.
   - Consider RabbitMQ or Amazon SQS for reliable messaging
   - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Design idempotent operations to handle repeated messages

5. **Domain-Driven Design**: Organize code around business capabilities.
   - Align service boundaries with business domains
   - Use a ubiquitous language throughout the code and documentation
   - Model the domain independently from any persistence or delivery mechanisms

### System Boundaries

1. **Clearly Define API Contracts**: Establish clear contracts between components.
   - Use interface definitions to define component boundaries
   - Provide detailed API documentation
   - Consider using API-first development

2. **Versioning Strategy**: Plan for evolution of the system.
   - Version APIs explicitly
   - Maintain backward compatibility whenever possible
   - Deprecate features before removing them

### Monitoring and Observability

1. **Comprehensive Logging**: Implement structured logging.
   - Use consistent log levels
   - Include correlation IDs in logs
   - Log important business events

2. **Metrics Collection**: Track system health and performance.
   - Record request rates, error rates, and latencies
   - Monitor resource utilization
   - Set up alerting for anomalies

3. **Distributed Tracing**: Implement trace context propagation.
   - Use OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
   - Ensure trace IDs flow through the entire system
   - Analyze traces to identify bottlenecks

## API Design Best Practices

### RESTful Design

1. **Resource-Based Endpoints**: Organize APIs around resources.
   - Use noun-based resource names (e.g., `/contexts`, `/tools`)
   - Use plural nouns for collections
   - Use hierarchical resources for related data (e.g., `/contexts/{id}/items`)

2. **HTTP Methods**: Use HTTP methods appropriately.
   - `GET` for retrieving data (read-only)
   - `POST` for creating resources
   - `PUT` for full updates
   - `PATCH` for partial updates
   - `DELETE` for removing resources

3. **Status Codes**: Use appropriate HTTP status codes.
   - `2xx` for success
   - `4xx` for client errors
   - `5xx` for server errors
   - Use specific codes like `400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `409`, etc.

4. **Consistent Error Format**: Use a standard error response format.
   - Include an error code, message, and details
   - Provide a correlation ID for troubleshooting
   - Be consistent across all endpoints

5. **HATEOAS**: Implement hypermedia links where appropriate.
   - Include links to related resources
   - Provide self-links for resources
   - Include pagination links for collections

### API Versioning

1. **Explicit Versioning**: Version APIs explicitly.
   - Use URL path versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/...`)
   - Support multiple versions simultaneously during transitions
   - Document version sunset policies

2. **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility within a version.
   - Add fields without breaking existing clients
   - Don't remove or rename fields within a version
   - Use optional parameters for new functionality

### Request/Response Handling

1. **Content Negotiation**: Support appropriate content types.
   - Use `application/json` as the default
   - Set appropriate `Content-Type` headers
   - Handle `Accept` headers properly

2. **Pagination**: Implement standard pagination for collections.
   - Use `limit` and `offset` parameters
   - Include pagination metadata in responses
   - Provide links to next/previous pages

3. **Filtering and Sorting**: Support filtering and sorting via query parameters.
   - Use consistent parameter names
   - Document all supported parameters
   - Validate and sanitize parameters

## Go Development Best Practices

### Code Style

1. **Follow Go Conventions**: Adhere to Go's idioms and conventions.
   - Use Go's standard formatting with `gofmt`
   - Follow the [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) guidelines
   - Use `golint` and `go vet` to catch common issues

2. **Naming Conventions**: Use clear, descriptive names.
   - Use MixedCaps for exported names
   - Use mixedCaps for non-exported names
   - Choose descriptive, unambiguous names

3. **Package Organization**: Organize code in coherent packages.
   - Package by feature, not by layer
   - Keep packages focused on a single responsibility
   - Avoid circular dependencies between packages

### Error Handling

1. **Explicit Error Handling**: Check and handle all errors.
   - Never ignore errors
   - Return errors rather than logging and continuing
   - Consider using error wrapping for context

2. **Centralized Error Types**: Define clear error types.
   - Use custom error types for domain-specific errors
   - Include context in error messages
   - Make errors easy to check programmatically

### Concurrency

1. **Goroutines Management**: Manage goroutines carefully.
   - Always handle goroutine termination
   - Use context for cancellation
   - Consider using worker pools for limiting concurrency

2. **Synchronization**: Use appropriate synchronization primitives.
   - Use mutex for simple shared state
   - Use channels for communication between goroutines
   - Prefer `sync.RWMutex` for read-heavy workloads

3. **Resource Management**: Manage resources properly.
   - Close all resources (files, connections, etc.)
   - Use `defer` for cleanup
   - Consider implementing graceful shutdown

### Dependency Injection

1. **Constructor Injection**: Use constructor injection for dependencies.
   - Pass dependencies to constructors rather than creating them inside
   - Use interfaces to define dependencies
   - Make dependencies explicit

2. **Configuration Management**: Handle configuration cleanly.
   - Use a centralized configuration system
   - Support different environments (dev, test, prod)
   - Validate configuration at startup

## Security Best Practices

### Authentication and Authorization

1. **Authentication**: Implement robust authentication.
   - Use industry-standard authentication methods (JWT, OAuth)
   - Store tokens securely
   - Implement token expiration and refresh

2. **Authorization**: Implement fine-grained authorization.
   - Follow the principle of least privilege
   - Check authorization for every action

3. **API Security**: Secure all API endpoints.
   - Require HTTPS for all communication
   - Implement appropriate rate limiting
   - Use API keys for service-to-service communication

### Input Validation

1. **Validate All Input**: Never trust input from external sources.
   - Validate request parameters, headers, and body
   - Use strict validation rules for all inputs
   - Sanitize input to prevent injection attacks

2. **Parameter Binding**: Be careful with parameter binding.
   - Explicitly define what fields can be bound
   - Don't automatically bind to sensitive fields
   - Validate bound data

### Secrets Management

1. **Secure Secrets Storage**: Never hardcode secrets.
   - Use environment variables or a secrets manager
   - Implement secrets rotation
   - Use different secrets for different environments

2. **Secure Communication**: Encrypt sensitive data in transit.
   - Use TLS for all HTTP communication
   - Use secure connections for database access
   - Consider encrypting sensitive data at rest

## Code Organization

The MCP Server codebase is organized into several key packages:

### Core Packages

- `cmd`: Entry points for executables
- `internal`: Internal code not meant to be imported
  - `api`: API server and handlers
  - `core`: Core business logic
  - `adapters`: Adapters for external systems
  - `repository`: Data access layer
  - `config`: Configuration management
- `pkg`: Public packages that can be imported by other projects
  - `client`: Client library for MCP Server
  - `mcp`: MCP domain models and interfaces

### Package Design Principles

1. **Clear Boundaries**: Each package should have a clear responsibility.
2. **Minimal Dependencies**: Minimize dependencies between packages.
3. **Stable API**: Public packages should have stable APIs.
4. **Internal Implementation**: Hide implementation details in internal packages.

### Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
mcp-server/
├── cmd/
│   ├── server/        # MCP Server entry point
│   └── mockserver/    # Mock server for testing
├── configs/           # Configuration files
├── docs/              # Documentation
├── internal/          # Internal packages
│   ├── api/           # API server
│   ├── core/          # Core business logic
│   ├── adapters/      # External system adapters
│   ├── repository/    # Data access
│   └── config/        # Configuration
├── pkg/               # Public packages
│   ├── client/        # Client library
│   └── mcp/           # MCP domain models
├── scripts/           # Helper scripts
└── test/              # Test resources
```

By following these principles and organization, we maintain a clean, maintainable, and extensible codebase that can evolve with changing requirements.
