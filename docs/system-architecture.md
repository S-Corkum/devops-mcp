# MCP Server System Architecture

This document describes the overall architecture of the MCP Server system.

## Architecture Overview

The MCP Server is designed with a modular, event-driven architecture that enables integration with multiple DevOps tools and platforms. The system is built with Go and follows modern design principles for scalability, resilience, and extensibility.

## Key Components

The MCP Server is composed of the following major components:

### 1. API Server

The API Server provides HTTP endpoints for interacting with the MCP platform, including:
- REST API endpoints for MCP protocol operations
- Webhook endpoints for receiving events from integrated systems
- Health and metrics endpoints for monitoring

The API Server is built using the Gin framework and includes:
- Request validation and authentication
- Rate limiting and CORS support
- Middleware for logging and metrics collection
- TLS support for secure communication

### 2. Core Engine

The Core Engine is the central component that processes events and orchestrates workflows. It:
- Receives events from adapters and external webhooks
- Processes events using a configurable number of worker goroutines
- Manages the lifecycle of events and ensures proper error handling
- Communicates with adapters to interact with external systems

### 3. Adapters

Adapters provide the interface between the MCP Server and external systems. Each adapter:
- Implements a common interface defined in the adapters package
- Handles communication with a specific external system (GitHub, Harness, etc.)
- Translates between the external system's API and the MCP's internal models
- Provides health checks and graceful shutdown capabilities

Current adapters include:
- GitHub Adapter
- Harness Adapter
- SonarQube Adapter
- Artifactory Adapter
- Xray Adapter

### 4. Database

The Database component handles persistent storage of:
- Configuration data
- Event history and audit logs
- State information for long-running operations

The PostgreSQL database is used as the primary storage backend, with connection pooling and prepared statements for performance optimization.

### 5. Cache

The Cache component provides fast access to frequently needed data:
- Redis is used as the distributed cache implementation
- Multi-level caching with memory and distributed caches
- Configurable TTLs for different data types
- Intelligent cache invalidation based on events

### 6. Metrics

The Metrics component collects and exposes system performance metrics:
- Prometheus integration for metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards for visualization
- Custom metrics for MCP-specific operations
- Health checks for system components

## Data Flow

### Event Processing Flow

1. External events enter the system through:
   - Webhook endpoints in the API Server
   - Polling via adapters (for systems without webhook support)
   
2. The API Server validates webhook signatures and formats the event data

3. Events are passed to the Core Engine for processing

4. The Core Engine:
   - Logs the event
   - Records metrics
   - Processes the event based on its source and type
   - May trigger further actions via adapters
   
5. Results are stored in the database and cached as needed

### API Request Flow

1. Clients make HTTP requests to the API Server endpoints

2. The API Server:
   - Authenticates the request
   - Validates the request parameters
   - Rate limits if configured
   
3. The request is routed to the appropriate handler

4. The handler calls the Core Engine to process the request

5. The Core Engine may interact with adapters or the database

6. Results are returned to the client as a JSON response

## Resilience Patterns

The MCP Server implements several resilience patterns:

### Circuit Breakers

Circuit breakers are used to prevent cascading failures when communicating with external systems:
- Each adapter implements circuit breaking for API calls
- Failed calls are tracked and circuit is opened after threshold is reached
- Periodic health checks are used to determine when to close the circuit

### Retry Mechanisms

Retries with exponential backoff are used for transient failures:
- Configurable retry counts and delays for each adapter
- Only retryable errors trigger retry logic
- Context timeouts ensure retries don't continue indefinitely

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is implemented at multiple levels:
- Client-facing API endpoints to prevent abuse
- External API calls to stay within service limits
- Event processing to manage system load

### Graceful Degradation

The system is designed to degrade gracefully when components fail:
- Non-critical features can be disabled when dependencies are unavailable
- Fallback mechanisms for critical operations
- Comprehensive error handling throughout the codebase

## Scalability

The MCP Server is designed to scale horizontally:
- Stateless API servers can run in multiple instances
- Event processing is distributed across worker pools
- Database and cache components can be scaled independently
- Kubernetes deployment enables auto-scaling based on load

## Security Considerations

Security is a core consideration in the architecture:
- TLS encryption for all communication
- JWT and API key authentication for API endpoints
- Webhook signature verification to prevent spoofing
- Secure storage of credentials and secrets
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks

## Development Architecture

For local development, the MCP Server includes:
- Mock server for simulating external systems
- Docker Compose setup for local dependencies
- Configuration templates for common scenarios
- Test utilities for unit and integration testing

## Future Architecture Evolution

The MCP Server architecture is designed for future expansion:
- New adapters can be added without changing the core
- The event system can be extended for new event types
- Additional storage backends can be supported
- Cloud-native features can be enhanced for different environments
