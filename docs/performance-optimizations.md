Concurrency Management:

Worker pools with configurable concurrency limits
Context-based cancellation for all operations
Non-blocking operations where possible


Caching Strategy:

Multi-level caching (memory + ElastiCache)
Intelligent cache invalidation based on events
Configurable TTLs for different data types


Database Optimizations:

Connection pooling with optimal settings
Prepared statements for frequent queries
Batch operations for bulk updates
Read/write splitting when using Aurora


Resilience Patterns:

Circuit breakers for external services
Retry with exponential backoff
Rate limiting for external API calls
Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
