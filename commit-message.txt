feat: Add Harness.io webhook subscription support

This commit adds support for subscribing to Harness.io webhooks from the MCP server.
The implementation includes:

- Enhanced Harness adapter to generate and store webhook URLs
- Added webhook URL endpoints for Harness.io configuration
- Updated configuration to support Harness.io webhook URL components
- Added documentation for Harness.io webhook integration
- Created test script for validating webhook functionality
- Added unit tests for webhook URL generation

The MCP can now be used as a webhook receiver for Harness.io, allowing
seamless integration between Harness.io and the MCP platform. This enables
event-driven automation based on Harness.io pipeline events.
