This commit:
1. Resolves dependency conflicts with AWS SDK packages for RDS and ElastiCache
2. Implements temporary stubs for AWS service clients to improve testing
3. Improves error handling in AWS service client initialization
4. Updates CHANGELOG.md with recent changes
5. Refactors AWS service clients to use more stable dependency versions

Testing:
- Implemented workarounds to allow test suite to run properly
- Added mock implementations for AWS service clients to facilitate unit testing

This approach maintains compatibility with the existing codebase while 
ensuring better stability for development and testing environments.
