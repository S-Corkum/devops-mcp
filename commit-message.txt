feat: Add AWS integrations with IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)

This commit implements AWS service integrations using IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)
for secure, credential-less authentication in EKS deployments:

- Implement RDS Aurora PostgreSQL with IAM-based authentication
- Implement Redis ElastiCache with cluster mode and IAM authentication
- Enhance S3 integration with IAM-based authentication
- Create Kubernetes manifests with IRSA annotations for EKS deployment
- Update port configuration to support both development (8080) and production (443)
- Add comprehensive documentation for AWS service configuration
- Provide IAM policy templates for all AWS services
- Add local development setup for Redis cluster mode testing
- Update application configuration to support the new AWS integrations
- Implement shared AWS authentication module

The implementation follows best practices for AWS service integration in EKS:
- Use IRSA to eliminate the need for static credentials
- Implement connection pooling for all services
- Ensure proper error handling and failover capabilities
- Support both production (IRSA) and local development environments
