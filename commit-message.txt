test: Improve unit test coverage for cmd, pkg, and internal directories

- Add comprehensive tests for mockserver functionality to ensure correct mock API responses
- Add extensive tests for client package to verify API interaction
- Implement tests for context-related structures in mcp package
- Add thorough testing for adapter models in models package
- Verify proper serialization/deserialization of model structures
- Ensure all major functions have adequate test coverage

These tests improve the overall reliability of the codebase by verifying core
functionality and ensuring proper behavior of the client, models, and server
components. The test coverage now extends to previously untested areas of the
codebase.
